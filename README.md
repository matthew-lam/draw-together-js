## About

A very basic, simple and barebones paint tool created for the purpose of learning Javascript. 
Both front-end (React) and back-end (Node) frameworks have been utilised in this project.

This online paint app allows multiple people to draw on a canvas at once and collaborate with drawing and doodling. This is mostly just a project for fun and to learn web app development.

This web app features real-time drawing and rendering of user drawable lines.
Real-time drawing and rendering can be enabled or disabled via code.


There is still a LOT of work to be done on this project, namely the following things need to be worked on: optimisation of performance for real-time rendering, bug fixing (color palette is buggy) and CSS/layout needs to be re-done (especially for the buttons/color palette).

Feel free to look over or fork the code and work on it yourself, if you so please.

- Run server-side code - 'node ./src/server.js' 
- Use 'localhost:3000' to access the web app. Multiple instances of the app can be ran.
